The peixe project
=================

In this project we will try do develop an engine to support inductive interactive
processing of textual documents:
 * Compare set of *almost* identical documents and induce (not deduce) forms to be filled in;
 * so, self-educated [Auto]Filling engine (AFE);
 * Domain ontology induction as thesauruses and using it in the AFE;
 * Document structure induction and arrange it in an ontology also;
 * Document structure user interface and AFE support;
 * etc.
