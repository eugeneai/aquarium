The peixe project
=================

(web page is at http://eugeneai.github.com/peixe/)

Already so tired of filling in various document papers... Why not fill the in a forms and just print and sign. Or... save their field content in a database or QR-code? Later the data can be used again.

Sometimes in a preparation of a draft treaty texts small error must be corrected in all its descendants simultaneously.

In this project we will try do develop an engine to support inductive interactive processing of textual documents:
 * Compare set of *almost* identical documents and induce (not deduce) forms to be filled in;
 * so, self-educated [Auto]Filling engine (AFE);
 * Domain ontology induction as thesauruses and using it in the AFE;
 * Document structure induction and arrange it in an ontology also;
 * Document structure user interface and AFE support;
 * etc.

Later we will try to "mine" a relational database structures from the data collected.
